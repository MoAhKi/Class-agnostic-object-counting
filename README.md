# Class-agnostic-object-counting


My PyTorch implementation of "[Class-agnostic Few-shot Object Counting](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Yang_Class-Agnostic_Few-Shot_Object_Counting_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)".

# Setup

This code is written in Python 1.9. There are some require packages:

1.matplotlib

2.torch

3.numpy

4.opencv

The code is trained on COCO dataset including 80 classes. The input images are randomly cropted to 224*224.
